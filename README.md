# Data-Analyst-Track-Wk2: My First Project: Castro Technology.
 Week two of my Data Analyst  Track Programme.
 # Basic Mathematic Operations in Excel
Learnt about how to perform some basic mathematical operations on Excel such as, SUM, DIVIDE, AVERAGE, MIN, MAX, COUNT, COUNTA, MEAN etc. 

# Data Cleansing 
Data cleansing is an important aspect of data-preprocessing in analysis because often times, the data from the data source are dirty, corrupted by databases and websites or applications. Therefore, data cleaning is neccesarry. 

I learnt about functions like the CLEAN, TRIM, and SUBSTITUTE.

# The Trim Function
The Trim function is used to remove non printable characters i.e. characters that are not readable in excel and has affeected the quality of the data.
syntax: Trim(value)

# The Clean Function
The Clean is to remove inconsistence spacing in Excel.
syntax: Clean (value)

# The Substitute Function
The Substitute can be applied when its impossible to clean and trim the values that need to be cleaned. It is used to replace unwanted characters or values.
syntax: Substitute (value)

# My First Project In Class: Castro Technology
After the teaching in class the Castro technology was given has a take home assignment.

# Case Study: Castro Technologies
Castro Technologies is a new player in the FinTech space. The company has employees from diverse backgrounds and demography. Millenials, Gen-Z, Baby Boomers, etc
Due to the high attrition rate within the tech space, where
employees find it very easy to switch roles across similar
companies offering better perks and job benefits, Castro
technologies decided to deploy some strategies to retain
their employees.

One of the strategies is to provide a world-class gym for
staff. However to go ahead with the gym, the Head of
People, Ms Temitope Pearce would like some analysis to be
carried out for her to help her make a decision
“You have been employed as a Data Analyst to
make sense of the business data for Ms. Pearce.”

# Questions To Analyze

1. Find the average age of employees in the organization
2. Calculate the total number of employees in the organization using
either Named Ranges or Structured Referencing
3. Group employees into 2
a) Employees with performance score less than 70 – Low
Performing
b) Employees with performance score of 70 and above – High
Performing
4. Based on the performance of the employees, would you advice Ms.
Pearce to go ahead with the gym?
